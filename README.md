# Slang

## About

A tiny toy for teaching/learning about PL implementation and design.

...

## Ideas

    - "Jargon" or dialects you can project a 'metalang' into
    - Polymorphic/higher-kinded types
    - Components built into language (first-class 'componentiation' operator, function 'modulation' -- )
    - ...but let's start very simple, with:
        - arithmetic
        - values
        - function application
        - function definition
